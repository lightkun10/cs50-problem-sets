TODO(in general)
1. Open memory card
2. Look for beginning of JPEG
3. Open a new JPEG file
4. Write 512 bytes until new JPEG is found
5. Stop at end of file



Open memory card
Repeat (some process) until end of card
    Read 512 bytes into a buffer
    If start of new JPEG
        If first JPEG
            start writing "000.jpg",
            and start writing my very first file
        Else (already found a JPEG before)
            close the file I've just writing to
            so I can open up this new file that I am
            going to continue writing to
    Else
        If already found JPEG
            keep writing to it
Close any remaining files

-- fread return number of elements successfully read (blocks)
