STR = Short Tandem Repeat

===== Specification =====
Implement a program that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs.

# Require two cli arguments:
  1. the name of CSV file
        containing the STR counts for a list of individuals
  2. the name of a text file 
        containing the DNA sequence to identify
    # Incorrect number of cli arguments? 
        Print error message of my choice(with print()).
    # Correct number of cli arguments?
        Assume that the first arguments is valid CSV file,
        second argument is a valid text file

# My program should open the CSV file and read its contents into memory
    # first col: name, the rest: STR sequences

# My program should open the DNA sequences
    and read its contents into memory

# For each of the STRs (from the first line of the CSV file),
    my program should compute the longest run of consecutive repeats 
    of the STR in the DNA sequence to identify.

# If the STR counts match exactly with any of the individuals in the CSV file, 
    my program should print out the name of the matching individual.
    # I may assume that the STR counts will not match 
        more than one individual.
    # If the STR counts do not match exactly with any of the individuals in 
        the CSV file, your program should print "No match".

===== Walkthrough =====
-- Open the CSV file and DNA sequences,
   read contents into memory, in my py program.
        - Python's csv module has reader and DictReader:
            reader: sequences of lists
            DictReader: sequences of dictionary. 
        - Python's sys module gives me access to
            sys.argv for cli arguments.
        - Once I've opened a text file f using open(filename),
            I can read its contents using f.read().

-- For each STR, compute the longest run of
    consecutive repeats in the DNA sequence.
    - For each position, in the sequence: compute how many
        times the STR repeats starting at that position.
    - For each position, keep checking successive 
        substrings until the STR repeats no longer

-- Compare above STR counts against each row 
    in the CSV file.




+++ Maybe I can store the sequences in a list...
